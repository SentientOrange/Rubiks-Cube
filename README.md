# Rubiks-Cube
This program was created for learning about Artificial Intelligence and Reinfocement Learning.
Q Learning was the technique chosen for this implementation of a Rubik's Cube Solver.

# Cube

Object can represent 2x2x2 and 3x3x3 sized cubes

## Topics
- Reinforcement Learning with Q Learning
- Machine Learning
- Finding convergence for reward functions when evaluating huge state spaces
  - Reduce the state space using a more generalized state representation
