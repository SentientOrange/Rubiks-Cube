TODO:

evaluate:

feature definition - list of features, figure out how to evaluate each feature
weighing features - (layers?) weigh layers higher, having completed side high, all 6 completed sides high, crosses > corner (on the same face only)

state s -> look at 12 actions 
take the action, calculate the features for each resulting, add to table, take most optimal 80% of time, if the same, choose randomly

1/count for every action-state to discourage taking same action multiple times

remove previous action from future action set
