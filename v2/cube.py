# Rubiks Cube Representation

# In order to do this project, we need to define a Rubiks Cube and all provide state management
# An agent should be able to perform any of the different rotations which will allow the agent to solve the cube.

# We will construct this with a 3x3x3 traditional Rubik's Cube in mind
